# Android Offline Validation Report

- Gradle network access: unavailable (detected via `gradlew --no-daemon help`).
- Local plugin repository: **missing** required jars in `android/gradle/plugins/`.
- Settings configuration: configured for `flatDir` plugin repositories.
- Action required: copy Kotlin 1.9.24, Android Gradle Plugin 8.9.1, Google Services 4.4.2 (and their dependencies) into `FamilyAppFlutter/android/gradle/plugins/`.

Once the jars are in place, rerun `scripts/android-offline-build.sh` to assemble the debug APK offline.
